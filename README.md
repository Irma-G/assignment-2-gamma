# Asmt2-Gaussian-mixtures

This will serve as your team repository, where the files you create to complete the assignment will reside.  Remember the specifics of the assignment can be found in the [MT4113 assignment 2 Moodle folder](https://moody.st-andrews.ac.uk/moodle/mod/folder/view.php?id=392699)  

I have populated this repository only with this README.md file and the beginning of the `teamEM()` function.  The remaining functions and files are for you to determine.

Along with the R code files you create, you are also to place into this repository a document describing the design and team member responsibilities.  I do not expect the design diagram to be elaborate; hand-drawn is fine.  The design will describe purpose, inputs and outputs of each function as well as member responsibilities (programmer, tester, documenter).  The diagram is intended to depict the relationship among the handful of functions your team creates.  This design/responsibility document will be best created as a PDF file you can upload to the repository.  Create the design document collaboratively, and refer to it during the work on the assignment.

I encourage you to edit this README.md file to place your team members names, and perhaps contact details.  That way, when you access this repository, you have your team member's details at your disposal.
